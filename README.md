## 📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of my coursework and practical laboratory exercises completed during the **Programming Using C** curriculum at Rajalakshmi Engineering College (REC). Spanning 16 weeks of rigorous training, this collection represents not just lines of code, but a fundamental transformation in my approach to problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

While high-level languages often abstract away the complexities of the machine, C forced me to confront them. This workbook documents my journey from writing basic "Hello World" scripts to architecting complex solutions involving manual memory management, pointer arithmetic, and data structure manipulation.

## 🚀 The Journey & The Learning Curve

When I began this module, I viewed programming primarily as a tool for automation. However, diving into the depths of C revealed the precise, often unforgiving nature of computational logic. 

The transition was not without its challenges. There were late nights spent analyzing segmentation faults, wrestling with buffer overflows, and untangling the logic of recursive functions. There were moments where the logic seemed sound, but the compiler disagreed, forcing me to abandon assumptions and step through the execution flow byte by byte.

Through this process, I learned that **efficiency is not an accident.** It is the result of deliberate choices regarding data types, memory allocation, and algorithmic complexity. This repository is evidence of my transition from simply "getting code to run" to understanding *how* it runs at the hardware level—a skill I believe is crucial for building robust, scalable systems.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The exercises are organized chronologically, mirroring the increasing complexity of the syllabus:

* **Weeks 1–5: The Fundamentals**
    * Control structures, loops, and conditional logic.
    * *Key Takeaway:* Building the logic for robust error handling and input validation.
* **Weeks 6–9: Memory & Arrays**
    * 1D/2D Arrays, matrix operations, and the introduction to contiguous memory storage.
    * *Key Takeaway:* Understanding row-major order and optimizing traversal loops.
* **Weeks 10–12: Strings & Functions**
    * String manipulation without standard libraries, recursion, and modular programming.
    * *Key Takeaway:* Mastering the "Pass by Reference" concept and stack memory behavior.
* **Weeks 13–16: Advanced Concepts**
    * Structures, Unions, and File I/O.
    * *Key Takeaway:* Managing complex data types and persistent data storage.

## 🧠 Key Competencies Demonstrated

* **Manual Memory Management:** Understanding the lifecycle of data and preventing leaks.
* **Algorithmic Optimization:** Implementing Sorting (Bubble, Insertion, Selection) and Searching (Linear, Binary) algorithms with a focus on time complexity.
* **Pointer Arithmetic:** Direct memory manipulation for efficient data processing.
* **Debugging & Analysis:** The ability to isolate logical errors in complex codebases.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

I must extend my sincere gratitude to the faculty at **Rajalakshmi Engineering College**. The problems presented in this workbook were far from trivial; they were designed to break our logic so that we could rebuild it stronger. 

My professors provided not just the answers, but the methodology to find them. Their insistence on clean syntax, proper indentation, and dry-run analysis instilled a discipline in me that goes beyond this course. They taught me that a good programmer writes code for humans to read, not just for machines to execute.
